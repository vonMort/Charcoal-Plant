# Charcoal Plant Mod for Victoria 3

The Charcoal Plant mod for Victoria 3 is a simple but useful modification that adds a new building to the game that allows players to create charcoal out of wood. This building, called the Charcoal Plant, is designed to help players who may be struggling to obtain enough coal to power their industries.

## Installation

To install the Charcoal Plant mod, simply download the latest version from the Releases page on this repository. Once downloaded, extract the mod files to your Victoria 3 mod folder, which is typically located at:

```
C:\Users\YOUR_USERNAME\Documents\Paradox Interactive\Victoria III\mod
```

Once the mod files are in the mod folder, launch Victoria 3 and enable the Charcoal Plant mod from the launcher.

## Usage

Once the mod is installed and enabled, you can start using the Charcoal Plant building in your game. The building can be constructed like any other industrial building and requires a certain amount of wood to produce charcoal.

To construct the Charcoal Plant, simply select the building from the construction menu and place it in a suitable location. Once constructed, the building will start producing charcoal automatically, as long as you have enough wood in your inventory.
